/**
 * Neo — the in-app agent.
 *
 * These are the contracts between the agent runtime and the panel that draws
 * it. They are shaped as the stream a real agent backend would send: a run
 * emits steps, questions and cards, and waits on the user where a card or a
 * question needs an answer. The prototype's scripted runtime produces exactly
 * these, so swapping it for a model changes where the events come from, not
 * what they are.
 *
 * DEV: POST /api/neo/runs streams `NeoEvent`s (SSE); the user's answers go
 * back on POST /api/neo/runs/:id/replies. camelCase here, as everywhere.
 */

/**
 * How much a tool call can change, which decides how much Neo asks.
 *
 * - read     — answers and lists. No confirmation.
 * - draft    — creates or edits work that is not yet approved. Previewed,
 *              applied on one key, undoable.
 * - commit   — approval, and anything that syncs to Tally. Neo never does this
 *              on its own; the user's keypress is the approval.
 * - external — anything that leaves the company: messages to vendors or
 *              customers. Shown verbatim, sent only on the user's say-so.
