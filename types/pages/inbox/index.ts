/**
 * Unified Inbox — page contracts.
 *
 * Every field is camelCase because production's apiClient converts camelCase to
 * snake_case on the way out and back again on the way in. This is what the
 * dev's fetch resolves to, with no mapping layer in between.
 *
 * Ported from the prototype's js/data.js (window.SEED). Two deliberate changes
 * from that file:
 *
 *  1. `receivedAt` is an ISO 8601 string, not a Date.now() offset. The original
 *     computed timestamps at module scope, which would differ between the
 *     server and client render and produce a hydration mismatch. An API returns
 *     an ISO timestamp anyway — format it for display at the point of use.
 *  2. `_batchTag` is `batchTag`. The underscore prefix was a prototype-ism.
