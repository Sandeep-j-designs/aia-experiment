/**
 * "Ask AWS for their GSTIN."

 * The one external task. Neo drafts the message from what the document says
 * and shows it word for word, editable; it goes only when the user sends it.
 * It goes to the address the vendor's bill came from. Without one, Neo hands
 * over the text instead of guessing a recipient.
 *
 * In the prototype the send is simulated and logged. Nothing leaves the page.
 *
 * DEV: tool — send_vendor_message(itemId, channel, body). WhatsApp goes
 * through the approved template API; free text only inside the 24-hour window.
