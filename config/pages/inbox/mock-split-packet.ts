/**
 * The sample month-end packet, as detection would return it.
 *
 * Carried over from the Bill Upload prototype so the demo exercises every
 * rule the PRD names: two confident bills, a blank separator left out
 * automatically, an item schedule on page 6 that could be either an annexure
 * or a new bill, and a third bill of seven pages. Remove the split at page 8
 * and bill 2 runs to 11 pages; remove the one at 4 as well and the merged bill
 * passes the 12-page limit and is created in parts.
 *
 * DEV: replace with GET /bill-splits/:id once detection returns a plan.
